1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,520
This first section is going to be
your personal introduction.

2
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,750
You will explain who you are
and which position you're applying to.

3
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,210
The first step is making it personal.

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,520
Start with a short introductory line:

5
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:23,358
who am I, what program am I studying at IE

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,490
and the position,
company or office I'm applying to.

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,800
This last part is important

8
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:34,050
as most companies have more than one vacancy
or graduate program open at the same time.

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,560
So, make sure to tell them
what job you are applying to.

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,640
Never make a recruiter
or hiring manager assume anything.

11
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,560
So, make it as clear as possible,

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,960
especially since recruiters
are more likely to discard cover letters

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,720
if it is not clear why they're reading them.

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,900
In addition, the heading should not be
"to whom it may concern".

15
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,170
If possible, find out the name of the recruiter,

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,330
the hiring manager
or at least the head of the department.
