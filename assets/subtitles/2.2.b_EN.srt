1
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:09,540
In the second section,

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,830
you're going to express
why you picked this company and position.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,040
Now grab their attention
and tell them why you picked them.

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,180
Don't just start talking about yourself.

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,210
You will talk about yourself later on.

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,130
This is where most students go wrong.

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,630
This is your shot to make the hiring manager
or the company feel special

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,720
and let them know
that you are genuinely interested in them.

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,410
This will grab their attention
and get them interested in you.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,700
You want to integrate emotion here

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,640
and show the hiring manager that you're not
just sending out a generic cover letter

12
00:00:39,926 --> 00:00:41,510
where you highlight your skills.

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,420
Go the extra mile

14
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,640
and make them feel this is the only company
you want to work for.

15
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:47,500
Remember,

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,050
the rule of thumb here is if the recruiter
can cover the company's name

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,210
and substitute for another company's name,

18
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,060
that means you have written
a generic cover letter

19
00:00:56,177 --> 00:00:58,160
and your candidacy might be discarded.

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,209
And try to refrain
from using trending buzzwords

21
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,360
or don't you say that they seem like
an exciting company to work for,

22
00:01:04,645 --> 00:01:06,160
they can see right through that.

23
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,880
Here, you want to give them the real reason
as to why you think they're exciting.

24
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,900
So remember, you're answering
the question "why this company?"

25
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,950
It's important to customize
this section as much as possible.

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,290
Here are some ways to do just that.

27
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,000
Check out their articles on social media,
like LinkedIn, for example.

28
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,780
You can mention the success
of a recent transaction

29
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,120
or something that stands out to you
about the company business

30
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,400
and where it's heading.

31
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:38,189
You can indicate that you attended
an on campus or virtual online event

32
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,780
which the company hosted or participated in,

33
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,840
highlight one of their speakers

34
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,840
and something you found interesting
about what they said.

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,120
Next, read available information,
go on the company website,

36
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,800
learn their values and mission.

37
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,720
You can read their news pages

38
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,930
and use their company culture vocabulary
in your cover letter.

39
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,500
Has anything caught your attention

40
00:01:59,642 --> 00:02:02,090
about their specific clients
or company strategies?

41
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,150
If so, use this approach and mention them.

42
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,190
Another alternative to customize
your cover letter is to ask yourself:

43
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,932
have you had a conversation with an alumni

44
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,060
or someone in your network working
at that company

45
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,300
that was meaningful to you?

46
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,630
Did they say anything about
the company that inspired you?

47
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,140
If so, mention how this inspired you to apply.

48
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,430
You can also research company directors
and see if you have anything in common:

49
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,060
which charities do they work with?

50
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,110
What type of volunteer work do they encourage
their employees to participate in?

51
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,260
Do you have something in common
with these company activities?

52
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,530
Here, you can use
an emotional attachment you have with them.

53
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,120
No matter what,
don't just say that they seem inspiring

54
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,630
because they've donated money
to their local charity for X amount of years.

55
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,960
Anyone can read the headlines of a website.

56
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,360
Pick something genuine that you can relate to

57
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,070
which will allow you to make that impact.

58
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,090
The idea is to show that you know
what differentiates their company

59
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,310
by having done your homework and research.

60
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,380
Remember,

61
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,750
this is what you find appealing
about this particular firm.
