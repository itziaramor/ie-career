QUIZ_FEEDBACK_SELECTION_1: 'This option should not be selected.'

QUIZ_ANSWER_2: 'Apply to the position without a cover letter and send one if they ask for it later. '
QUIZ_VAL_2: 'no'
QUIZ_FEEDBACK_SELECTION_2: ' This option should not be selected.'
QUIZ_FEEDBACK_TEXT_2: 'We recommend you put as much focus and energy into your cover letter as you do your CV. A good cover letter can make the biggest difference. For example, if you are shortlisted for a position, the hiring managers will go through your cover letter to make their decision. In addition, chances are your candidacy will be automatically filtered out for not following instructions properly.'

QUIZ_ANSWER_3: 'Prepare a cover letter to entice the reader to get to know me.'
QUIZ_VAL_3: 'yes'
QUIZ_FEEDBACK_SELECTION_3: 'This option should be selected.'
QUIZ_FEEDBACK_TEXT_3: 'Think of your cover letter as a sales pitch that will market your credentials and help you get the interview. You want to make sure your cover letter makes the best impression on the person who is reviewing it.'

QUIZ_ANSWER_4: 'Write a good generic cover letter for all the positions I am applying to.'
QUIZ_VAL_4: 'no'
QUIZ_FEEDBACK_SELECTION_4: 'This option should not be selected.'
QUIZ_FEEDBACK_TEXT_4: ' This is not recommended, as you should customize each cover letter to each position you are applying to. Once recruiters see a generic cover letter, they stop reading. It defeats the purpose of getting to know why you are a good fit for the role/company.'
