1
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,540
In this stage, you have to show them
how much you want it.

2
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,930
Keep in mind the person reading
your cover letter doesn't know you.

3
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,110
So, if you can make an emotional connection,
all the better.

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,790
As a result, in your closing, you really need
to think about using the right words.

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,500
Instead of the typical
"thanks for your consideration"

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,320
or "looking forward to hearing from you",

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,300
you can say something along the lines of

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,200
"I look forward to meeting you
in the next interview phase".

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,140
If you know what the next interview phase is,
then name it specifically.

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,750
You need to use language
that you feel comfortable with,

11
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,390
but shows the company that you really want this.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,420
In addition, if you decide
to say that you will follow up,

13
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,760
make sure you have their contact to do so.

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,910
Most importantly,
make sure you actually do follow up.

15
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:50,220
Remember,

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,040
we all want to work with people
who want to be part of our team

17
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:56,350
and your cover letter
is your chance to express just that.

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,800
Now, follow these steps
to write a winning cover letter

19
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,230
and let them know how much
you really want this position.

20
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:03,410
Good luck!
