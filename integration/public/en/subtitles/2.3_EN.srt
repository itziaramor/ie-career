1
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,060
How many of you have ever applied to a job?

2
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,070
Most of you, am I right?

3
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,630
Here is the journey of an IE student
who was in your shoes not so long ago.

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:17,630
Meet Anna.

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,780
Anna is a Master student at IE.

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,137
Anna has received
a Talent and Careers' newsletter

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,920
with a job opportunity
at Really Amazing Tech Firm.

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,460
She carefully reads the job requirements

9
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:32,290
and sees that applications
without a cover letter would not be considered.

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,950
Anna rushes home from class
to start working on the cover letter.

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,050
The time is currently 4 p.m.

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,260
Anna scratches her head thinking,

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,780
a light bulb pops up
with components of a cover letter.

14
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,160
The first part, self-introduction.

15
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,640
The second part, why the company?

16
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,890
The third part, why should the company choose me?

17
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,000
And the fourth part, the closing.

18
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,220
Anna is going on the Internet to research
about Really Amazing Tech Firm.

19
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,560
Then, Anna goes to Vault.com

20
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,770
and types in Really Amazing Tech Firm
for further research.

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,960
Anna goes to LinkedIn to connect to IE Alumni
that works at Really Amazing Tech Firm.

22
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,480
She invites the alumni
with the following request:

23
00:01:14,298 --> 00:01:15,386
Dear Ms. IE Alumni,

24
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,189
I am a current IE Master student
with a background in Marketing

25
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,160
looking to get into the Tech sector.

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,820
May I please have 20 minutes of your time

27
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:27,230
to ask about your experience
with Really Amazing Tech Firm?

28
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,080
Your insights would be helpful!

29
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,850
Thank you in advance for your time.

30
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:31,580
Anna.

31
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,597
It is now 6 p.m.,

32
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,760
Anna opens her Word processor
and starts writing.

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
It is now 10 p.m.,

34
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,400
Anna finishes the cover letter

35
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,270
and starts to think
of who can help her proofread it.

36
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,140
She remembers that her classmate Tommy
is a fluent English speaker.

37
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,900
Anna and Tommy meet in the coffee shop
and he reads and provides her feedback.

38
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,030
She opens her laptop and makes corrections.

39
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,740
Anna goes home.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,400
Anna arrives home and checks her LinkedIn.

41
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,840
IE Alumni accepts Anna's request
and says: "Let's chat today!"

42
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,180
Anna and IE Alumni have a video call.

43
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,740
IE Alumni says:

44
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,960
"Really Amazing Tech Firm
is a great firm to start your career".

45
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,760
Anna says:

46
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,410
"Thank you so much for your time.

47
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,060
Would you be comfortable
to recommend me to your firm?"

48
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,410
IE Alumni says:

49
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,480
"Sure, please send me your application".

50
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,130
Anna sends the application
with the cover letter to the IE Alumni.

51
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,200
Final progress report:

52
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,660
company research: two hours,

53
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,840

54
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,900

56
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,320
amazing cover letter and referral:

57
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:38,440
priceless.

58
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,840
These are the main actions
an IE student needs to complete

59
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,480
to apply to just one job post.

60
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,830
So, it's important to understand
that it takes time and serious effort.
