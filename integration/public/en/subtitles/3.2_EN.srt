1
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,000
Setting up your LinkedIn profile is easy

2
00:00:10,618 --> 00:00:12,000
and you want to make it smart too,

3
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:14,127
so it reflects your professional goals.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,672
Our experience has taught us this is key

5
00:00:16,756 --> 00:00:20,170
considering how international
and diverse we are in the IE community.

6
00:00:20,763 --> 00:00:22,112
Here are four insider tips:

7
00:00:22,581 --> 00:00:24,560
you want to set up a location for your profile,

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,349
set up a language for your profile,

9
00:00:26,676 --> 00:00:28,800
set up a personal LinkedIn URL,

10
00:00:29,094 --> 00:00:30,250
set up your visibility.

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,349
Set up a location for your profile.

12
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,600
When you're setting a location
for your profile,

13
00:00:34,836 --> 00:00:37,894
think about where your potential employers
or investors will be.

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,334
That is the location you want to have
on your LinkedIn profile.

15
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,985
Right now, you're studying your degree
in Spain.

16
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,669
It is possible that some of you
may want to stay in Spain for work,

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,141
others may want to go back to their home country
upon graduation

18
00:00:51,527 --> 00:00:54,374
and yet others may want to work
at an international hub

19
00:00:54,447 --> 00:00:55,952
in a different country altogether.

20
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,818
The location setting lets
prospective employers or investors

21
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:03,003
know where you wish to keep developing
your professional career.

22
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,258
If you are unsure as to what geography
you want to target,

23
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:07,163
that's okay.

24
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,247
It may be even too early in the program
for you to decide.

25
00:01:10,552 --> 00:01:12,516
You can just have Spain in your location

26
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:17,010
and state that you will be open to relocate
in your professional summary.

27
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,709
Set up a language for your profile.

28
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:21,872
When you're setting up the language for your profile,

29
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:23,661
go back to the earlier reflection

30
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:27,003
on which geography
you want to target after graduation.

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,298
Whatever language people speak there
will be the language for your profile.

32
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,207
In some countries,
English is the native language

33
00:01:34,316 --> 00:01:36,240
or the language preferred for business.

34
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:37,560
In other countries,

35
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:40,560
there may be a different,
more dominant language for business

36
00:01:40,658 --> 00:01:41,600
that is not English.

37
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,836
So, some of you may need to have
just the one profile in this language,

38
00:01:45,963 --> 00:01:46,632
in English,

39
00:01:46,836 --> 00:01:48,396
while others may need to have two,

40
00:01:48,927 --> 00:01:51,560
one in English, which is more or less standard,

41
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:54,592
and the other one in Spanish or Dutch,

42
00:01:55,003 --> 00:01:59,210
whatever language potential employers
and investors are going to be fluent in.

43
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,603
Set up a personal LinkedIn URL.

44
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:04,978
When we're thinking about establishing
an online presence,

45
00:02:05,247 --> 00:02:07,740
we need to consider
the online environment itself.

46
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,185
In it, URLs are very meaningful

47
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:13,890
to understand the content
to which they're taking us.

48
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,498
This is the case of your profile's URL.

49
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:20,265
The URL automatically assigned to you
by LinkedIn

50
00:02:20,429 --> 00:02:21,654
will look something like this.

51
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,647
You have the LinkedIn handle
followed by your name

52
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,960
with dashes
and a somewhat long series of numbers.

53
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,625
Be aware that it can
and should be personalized

54
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:35,100
just to show your name with a spelling
and style of your choosing.

55
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,705
You will be pasting this URL into your CV

56
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:43,770
and potentially it will be shared amongst
prospective employers or investors.

57
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,734
Personalizing your LinkedIn URL is easy.

58
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,840
Just go to your profile
on the upper right-hand corner

59
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:50,792
and change it.

60
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,516
Set up your visibility.

61
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,003
Decide what and when you want to share.

62
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,109
LinkedIn is all about sharing,

63
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:00,130
but at this point in time,
you will be working on your profile

64
00:03:00,218 --> 00:03:02,460
and making many changes, big and small.

65
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,760
So, you do not want your network
to be notified every time, right?

66
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:11,160
Remember to switch off sharing profile changes
with your network.

67
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,563
It is an automatic function on LinkedIn

68
00:03:14,636 --> 00:03:17,381
that works well
when you change your job title, for example,

69
00:03:17,807 --> 00:03:20,545
as it would let everybody know
that you just got a promotion

70
00:03:20,636 --> 00:03:21,276
- hurray! -

71
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,287
but it will not bode well for you

72
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,123
if you're in the initial stages
of setting up your profile

73
00:03:26,232 --> 00:03:27,389
or just making it better.

74
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,830
You can do this in the settings
and privacy tab in your profile.

75
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,560
The same goes
for your overall profile visibility.

76
00:03:34,912 --> 00:03:38,098
Keep it less restrictive
when you're looking for a professional change

77
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:42,000
or more restricted if you're not open
to new professional opportunities,

78
00:03:42,163 --> 00:03:44,421
so you will not appear in recruiter searches.

79
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:47,440
This you can manage as well
in the settings and privacy.
