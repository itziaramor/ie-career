1
00:00:08,447 --> 00:00:11,130
I want to talk to you
about the professional networking site

2
00:00:11,316 --> 00:00:11,883
LinkedIn.

3
00:00:12,618 --> 00:00:14,003
LinkedIn is a powerful tool

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,549
that you can use to establish
your professional online presence,

5
00:00:17,883 --> 00:00:19,749
network with prospective employers,

6
00:00:19,901 --> 00:00:21,872
clients and alumni from your school

7
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:24,000
and strategize your job search.

8
00:00:24,883 --> 00:00:27,312
This also applies
if you want to start your own business

9
00:00:27,389 --> 00:00:29,000
or freelance for different projects.

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,552
If you're not on LinkedIn

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,356
or you have a profile
but have not logged on for months,

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,676
pay close attention.

13
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:36,970
Here's why LinkedIn is a good idea.

14
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,225
First reason, it's be there or be square.

15
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,803
There are over 30 million companies
on LinkedIn and counting.

16
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,298
Bottom line is hiring managers
and even recruiters are there.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,796
Even if you applied through their website,

18
00:00:50,872 --> 00:00:53,585
there is a very good chance
that they will look you up online

19
00:00:53,883 --> 00:00:56,581
and your LinkedIn profile
will be high at the top of the search.

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,720
Having a good profile with an active network
will help you build trust and credibility.

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,465
Second reason, networking 101.

22
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,400
With over 600 million members and counting,

23
00:01:07,669 --> 00:01:11,149
LinkedIn is one of the biggest databases
of people in the world.

24
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:13,381
With this number of potential contacts,

25
00:01:13,523 --> 00:01:14,654
who would want to miss out?

26
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,660
Building a good network will always pay off.

27
00:01:17,803 --> 00:01:20,516
You never know who can provide you
with an important insight

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,180
or put in a good word of reference for a job.

29
00:01:24,338 --> 00:01:26,229
The networking being done on LinkedIn,

30
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:28,003
the one that really thrives anyways,

31
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,785
is informational networking,

32
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:33,709
the kind that is driven by sharing
of content and professional opinion,

33
00:01:34,185 --> 00:01:37,552
but not so much the one that asks
for job referrals from the get-go.

34
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,830
Also, since potential clients
and investors are there too,

35
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,192
networking will definitely help
if you're starting up a company

36
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,447
or even founding the next unicorn startup,

37
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:48,276
who knows!

38
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,480
What matters is that you're present,

39
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:53,123
interacting in this unique professional forum

40
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,527
and you can make it extensive to the real world.

41
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,112
Anyone you meet at an event or conference,

42
00:01:58,363 --> 00:02:01,763
you can ask to be a connection
and keep in touch through LinkedIn.

43
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,327
This is common practice
and really helps to keep connections alive.

44
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:08,825
Just remember to add a message
to your connection request.

45
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,580
It will help the person place you
and follow up with you in the future.

46
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:15,861
Third reason, job search strategy made easy.

47
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:20,720
There are over 20 million open job listings
on LinkedIn at any given time.

48
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,774
You can search for jobs by geography,
by role, by company, by keyword,

49
00:02:26,207 --> 00:02:26,938
you name it.

50
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,003
This abundance is fantastic

51
00:02:29,287 --> 00:02:32,170
because it gives you the opportunity
to learn about your market.

52
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,000
You can identify trends,

53
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:36,549
like sought-after roles or growing companies,

54
00:02:36,887 --> 00:02:39,883
or see how one role
varies from one company to another.

55
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,250
Understanding what is needed out there

56
00:02:42,334 --> 00:02:45,443
will help you leverage your profile
and play in your strengths.
