Hi.

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,520
On behalf of
IE Talent and Careers' team,

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,500
it is my pleasure to welcome you
on this online learning journey.

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,340
Professional development
is one of the main goals

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,690
of our students and alumni

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,380
and we have designed this course

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,840
to give you a head start
to reach your career goals.

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,290
As you may know,

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,370
many of our top companies begin
their campus recruitment cycle

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,920
in the fall for full-time
and internship positions.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,280
So, it is important for you
to start preparing as soon as possible,

12
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,290
so that you are ready for those processes.

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,020
This course will introduce you
to the essential components

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,630
of a job application package.

15
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,520
Firstly, we'll begin by showing you
how to build the perfect resume

16
00:00:44,646 --> 00:00:46,650
or CV, as it is widely called in Europe.

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,200
Throughout this course, we'll use the terms
CV and resume interchangeably,

18
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,720
so don't let that confuse you.

19
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,200
Second, we will move
to writing powerful cover letters.

20
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,300
And finally, we will cover
how to best use LinkedIn.

21
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,540
Preparing these three components
is the first step of your job search strategy.

22
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:08,680
You may be thinking, "what is a job search strategy
and why do I need one?"

23
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,360
In our experience,

24
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,860
students that have structured
their job search approach are more likely

25
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,400
to achieve their professional goals.

26
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,300
These students start early and, as a result,
are able to leverage all of the resources

27
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,880
that are available for them at the IE.

28
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,603
Their job applications make their way
to the interview shortlist

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,400
of even the most exclusive companies

30
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,618
and they are more successful
during their interview processes

31
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,500
as a result of their intense preparation.

32
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,540
So, please take advantage of this first step
in your journey with us and enjoy.
