00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:08,930
Welcome back.

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,493
During this video,

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,400
we will learn about
applicants tracking systems

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,560
and how to optimize our CVs

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,080
to make sure they reach
recruiters and hiring managers sites.

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,281
As you may know,
applicant tracking systems are software

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,020
that simplify
the recruitment processes for companies

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,500
by ranking the applicants they receive

9
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:32,000
based on the information
that appears in their CVs.

10
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:37,695
Applicant tracking systems collect
information of all the applicants to a job

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,834
and compare them

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,950
based mainly on the keywords
that the candidates include in their CV.

13
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,565
These keywords could reflect
technical skills, competencies

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,710
or the knowledge of software
amongst many others.

15
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,793
They will rank all the applicants
based on the keywords

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,820
and provide the recruiters
and hiring managers with a list

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,310
of the most suitable candidates.

18
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,483
Most top employers use this type of system

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,640
to simplify and speed up
their recruitment processes

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,120
as they usually screen out around
70% of the resumes they receive

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,260
for each position that get posted.

22
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,693
This is either because their experience
does not reflect the desired qualifications

23
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,800
or because they are submitted in formats
that are illegible for the system.

24
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,180
Making sure that we use the correct keywords

25
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,920
and we submit our CVs in an adequate format
can increase our chances

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,650
of moving past this initial screening process.

27
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,760
Throughout this online program,

28
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,810
we have already mentioned the importance
of tailoring our CV to each job we apply to.

29
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:50,220
Make sure your CV includes keywords
relevant to the job you're applying for.

30
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,230
These keywords will be available
not only in the job description,

31
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,277
but also in the company web page,

32
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,090
where you might be able
to find further information

33
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,410
on what an ideal candidate
would look like for that company.

34
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,220
Most relevant keywords
can be used more than once

35
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,512
since the system will give you points

36
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,200
for every time these keywords
appear on your resume.

37
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,360
But make sure you don't overuse them,

38
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,680
up to a level in which they stop making sense.

39
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,845
Make sure you start preparing
and identifying the most relevant keywords

40
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,940
for your target sector and role
as soon as possible.

41
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,340
Project management for consulting

42
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,000
or financial modeling for finance
are just a couple of examples,

43
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,240
but these keywords will change
depending on the sector

44
00:02:35,394 --> 00:02:37,510
and even some time on the companies.

45
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,078
Companies with
very strong corporate culture can even

46
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,540
have keywords of their own.

47
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,600
Including sector specific keywords
in your CV could be difficult

48
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,760
if you don't have
any professional experience in that sector.

49
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,080
But good news,

50
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,530
you can use your professional summary
to include the keywords

51
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,420
that are relevant for the role,
but may be difficult to incorporate

52
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,500
within your educational
or professional experience sections.

53
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,910
Include the date in your work experience
and education sections.

54
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,520
The system might try to filter
by the years of experience

55
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,880
or your graduation date by reading these.

56
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,300
Make sure you use both acronyms
and the long format version of keywords.

57
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,740
For example,
MBA and Master in Business Administration

58
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:26,310
or MIM and Master In Management.

59
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,480
ATS like simple formats with traditional fonts.

60
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,320
It is easier for them to read
through this type of CVs.

61
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,100
So, avoid using tables,
columns or fancy graphics.

62
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,060
Make sure you use
standard resume section headlines,

63
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,220
such as education or professional experience,

64
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,740
to make it easier for the system to identify them

65
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,170
and submit your CV in a .docx format when possible.

66
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,220
As you can see, optimizing your CV

67
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,520
through this first online screening process
requires planning and time.

68
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,280
There are lots of online resources out there

69
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,720
that will help you prepare to beat ATS.

70
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,560
