1
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,610
Just like I mentioned in the first section,
"Why using LinkedIn is a good idea?",

2
00:00:13,003 --> 00:00:15,770
hiring managers, recruiters
and investors are all there.

3
00:00:16,236 --> 00:00:17,949
Even if you applied through their website

4
00:00:18,145 --> 00:00:19,978
or you connected with them through other means,

5
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:22,658
there is a very good chance
that they will look you up online.

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,320
Your LinkedIn profile will be high
at the top of the search in Google,

7
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,374
and having a good solid profile
will help you build trust and credibility.

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,447
This is also true
even if you're not actively looking for a job.

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,254
Headhunters in HR know
that some of the best professionals out there

10
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,541
are the ones that are not looking for a change.

11
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,756
They are already doing great work
and making a difference where they are,

12
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:46,243
and so they're even more appealing to them.

13
00:00:46,872 --> 00:00:48,174
If you are one of those,

14
00:00:48,316 --> 00:00:51,803
a good LinkedIn profile will guarantee
you can be found by recruiters

15
00:00:51,894 --> 00:00:53,701
and get the call for an interesting job.

16
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,443
Then the decision will be yours
on whether to pursue it or not.

17
00:00:58,287 --> 00:01:01,476
LinkedIn tells us that members
that have a complete profile

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,560
get 40 times more views than members
with an incomplete profile,

19
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,356
so it is always worth it
to invest your time on this.

20
00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:12,178
But how exactly do you build
a good solid profile?

21
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:13,338
Let's find out.

22
00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:17,363
There are eight main sections
in your LinkedIn profile worth thinking about.

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,134
We will go through each one
and tell you about a couple others extra.

24
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,232
You have the picture,
the headlines, the About section,

25
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:30,970
education, professional experience, skills,
recommendations and interests.

26
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,330
The first part,
an informative profile headline.

27
00:01:34,421 --> 00:01:35,356
Regarding headline:

28
00:01:35,476 --> 00:01:39,261
your headline is a short,
memorable professional slogan for yourself,

29
00:01:39,669 --> 00:01:42,094
and it is also a declaration of intentions.

30
00:01:42,178 --> 00:01:46,000
It is the perfect place to state
where you see yourself after graduating.

31
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,869
Look at these examples.

32
00:01:48,105 --> 00:01:53,400
You have: MBA, digital transformation,
e-commerce, retail, banking, finance.

33
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:54,938
Another example:

34
00:01:55,007 --> 00:02:00,138
B.A., international relations,
sustainability, technology, NGOs,

35
00:02:00,585 --> 00:02:03,349
and MSE, international management,

36
00:02:03,505 --> 00:02:07,258
consultant, driving digitalization
in retail and e-commerce.

37
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,003
These headlines look interesting, don't they?

38
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,505
It's because they are very targeted
to what their owners want.

39
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,661
Note how they have education,
role, and finally sector.

40
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,850
Search algorithms on LinkedIn
will pick up on these keywords

41
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,923
and make your profile pop up
for any headhunter or prospective employer

42
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:27,436
looking for such skills.

43
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,807
If you're not clear on what you want exactly,
that's okay.

44
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,003
Hunt for keywords in job postings
you would be interested in applying for.

45
00:02:35,498 --> 00:02:37,727
So, don't just write "MBA candidate"

46
00:02:37,818 --> 00:02:39,745
or "Master's in management candidate",

47
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,520
a prospective employer or headhunter
would never search for just that.

48
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,800
Craft your very own headline
and make your profile really stand out.

49
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,461
Pick your photos.

50
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,610
You get to have two photos
on your LinkedIn profile.

51
00:02:52,716 --> 00:02:56,527
Make good use of this opportunity
to establish your professional brand.

52
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,487
There is your picture and the background image.

53
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,392
Your picture
should definitely be professional.

54
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:04,694
Wear a business or a business casual attire,

55
00:03:05,065 --> 00:03:07,276
make sure there's a light
and neutral background,

56
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:09,003
and throw in a nice smile.

57
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,850
Avoid cutaways from group pictures,
or full-body pictures,

58
00:03:12,934 --> 00:03:14,912
where your face will not be seen clearly.

59
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,563
The background image should resonate
with your professional goals.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,760
This is a good chance to get creative,
give it a shot!

61
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:26,312
Try out a couple of images
and get feedback from your classmates

62
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,923
to double check if you're sending
the right message.

63
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,880
Develop a unique professional summary.

64
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,440
After defining your title
and picking your photos,

65
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,630
you will have noticed that LinkedIn
is a place to shine.

66
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,840
You get to show off your brand
and what you're all about.

67
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,960
So, in the professional summary,

68
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:49,360
try not to just copy and paste
from the professional summary in your CV.

69
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:51,221
You're more than just that.

70
00:03:51,476 --> 00:03:54,061
Tell your story to connect
with a visitor of your profile

71
00:03:54,123 --> 00:03:55,676
so they want to know more about you.

72
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:59,774
Go beyond typical buzzwords
such as "creative problem solver"

73
00:03:59,843 --> 00:04:02,000
and "passion about technology and innovation".

74
00:04:02,058 --> 00:04:05,340
That all sounds fine,
but the question is this:

75
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,000
why would you like to join this or that sector?

76
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,310
What kind of challenges
do you identify in the sector?

77
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,905
What kinds of problems do you like to solve?

78
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,000
Remember,
it's not about what you're looking for,

79
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:20,000
but what you can bring to a potential employer.

80
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,330
Ultimately,
prospective employers are interested

81
00:04:23,407 --> 00:04:26,240
in how they can benefit
from connecting with you.

82
00:04:27,407 --> 00:04:30,443
Include a link to your website,
if you have one, or any other media,

83
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:33,741
such as published articles
or interviews you were featured in,

84
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,003
to make your profile all the more engaging.

85
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,007
Show off your education.

86
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:41,323
List out your education,
including your current IE studies

87
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,381
and the most recent.

88
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,760
Include all your schools, summer programs

89
00:04:44,858 --> 00:04:46,956
and complementary activities
you participated in,

90
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:48,258
like clubs or teams.

91
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:51,185
Don't be shy to show off your GPA scores,

92
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:53,705
only if they're outstanding though,
and honors.

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,560
It's perfectly appropriate to do so

94
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:58,938
and it might help a prospective employer
leans towards interviewing you

95
00:04:59,181 --> 00:05:00,334
instead of someone else.

96
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,621
Showcase your professional experience.

97
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,901
Although your first instinct is to state
that you're currently not working,

98
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,683
that's not necessarily true.

99
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:12,327
Continuing education is hard work.

100
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,163
The idea is to avoid having
your current experience as unemployed.

101
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,000
The easiest solution
is to list out your IE degree

102
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,869
as your current position right now,

103
00:05:22,123 --> 00:05:24,887
and make sure you list
the most relevant courses you are taking,

104
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,207
leadership positions,

105
00:05:26,443 --> 00:05:29,858
or any other activities you are
or will be participating in.

106
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,454
If you're considering changing careers,

107
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,240
this is also a great place
to demonstrate what you're doing

108
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,243
during your studies to close the gap

109
00:05:37,305 --> 00:05:40,000
between your previous career
and your aspired position.

110
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,621
Overall, the experience section
can help you showcase

111
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,298
all your past professional achievements
and projects,

112
00:05:46,676 --> 00:05:49,000
and without the space constraint
you have in your CV.

113
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,494
Your profile can be as long as you want.

114
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,920
Just remember it should be reader-friendly

115
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:55,378
and have a clear structure.

116
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:56,236
Here's a tip:

117
00:05:56,516 --> 00:05:59,840
use the first lines to explain
the type of company you worked for,

118
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:02,269
and any major accomplishments you had there.

119
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,254
Then you can move on to expand
on your experience within that company.

120
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,094
List out your skills and get endorsed for them.

121
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,243
This section is the place
to include keywords and phrases

122
00:06:13,305 --> 00:06:15,160
that a recruiter will actually search for.

123
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:18,450
Find relevant ones in job listings
that appeal to you

124
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:21,872
and profiles of people
you have in your network

125
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,538
with the kinds of roles you want.

126
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,756
List all your possible keywords
in the relevant language

127
00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:30,000
of the geography you're targeting
in their most common spelling.

128
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,440
For example, tech versus technology.

129
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,218
Other people on LinkedIn
will get the chance to endorse these skills.

130
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,003
However, the best endorsement

131
00:06:38,058 --> 00:06:40,790
will come from the recommendation section
coming up now.

132
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,745
Collect diverse recommendations.

133
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,476
The best profiles
have at least one recommendation

134
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:47,510
for every position they have had.

135
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,461
Reach out to your peers,
your professors, a teammate

136
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:52,007
or an ex-manager for this.

137
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,705
You can make their life easier,
telling them specifically what you need

138
00:06:56,094 --> 00:06:58,945
in terms of a skill or a project
you need endorsement for,

139
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,647
and if they would be comfortable
posting it on your LinkedIn profile.

140
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,265
You may reciprocate by providing
your own recommendations to them.

141
00:07:06,778 --> 00:07:09,501
Overall, these recommendations
are nice to have,

142
00:07:09,752 --> 00:07:12,636
but note that they will not substitute
official recommendations

143
00:07:13,018 --> 00:07:15,992
if a company requires them
during the recruitment process.

144
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,938
Show your connectedness
by building the interest sections.

145
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:24,483
Groups you join will appear
at the bottom of your LinkedIn profile.

146
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,600
By joining groups, you will be more engaged

147
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,047
in the different professional communities
within LinkedIn.

148
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,007
Start by joining your university
and sector-related groups,

149
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:35,745
where you will be able
to foster solid relationships

150
00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:37,000
with other professionals.

151
00:07:37,414 --> 00:07:40,447
But we will see more about this
in the following section of this course.

152
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,410
Also, follow companies of your interest
and leaders that inspire you.

153
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,829
Other sections in your LinkedIn profile
are licenses and certifications,

154
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:51,261
accomplishments, volunteer experience.

155
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,480
It helps to have your profile
as complete as possible.

156
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,447
You will get 40 times more views
with a 100% complete profile

157
00:07:58,752 --> 00:08:02,370
and you will give prospective employers
a better picture of who you are.
