00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:13,490
Hello and welcome to this first module of
our Talent and Careers' online learning journey.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,520
During this video,
you will learn how to write a compelling CV

3
00:00:17,636 --> 00:00:20,510
and you will familiarize with the IE CV template.

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,080
Your CV is a marketing document
that must be tailored

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,630
depending on the audience
you want it to direct it to.

6
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:32,570
Employers use the information in your CV
to determine how suitable you are for a position.

7
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,063
This means that you should customize
the information in your CV

8
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,980
to each position you apply for.

9
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,330
This is the IE CV template.

10
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,796
We will go through the different sections

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,850
for you to see what information
you should include in each one.

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,560
This template has been created
with the input of recruiters and alumni

13
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,810
from different sectors and locations

14
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,520
and you may have to do some small modifications

15
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,900
depending on the sector or the country
you are applying to.

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,040
It is a live document
that changes with recruitment trends.

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,960
Under your name, you should include
your contact information and work permits.

18
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,820
You should also add your LinkedIn URL,
but make sure you have shortened it before.

19
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,490
You will learn how to do this
on the LinkedIn module.

20
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,140
The first section in your CV
is your professional summary.

21
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,630
The professional summary
should be short and sweet.

22
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,838
Catch by the reader's attention,

23
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,058
point out information
that is highly relevant to the role

24
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,760
and help out the candidate
stand out from the rest.

25
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,540
So no overused common phrases
and generic skills.

26
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,080
For the most senior profiles,

27
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,900
this is the space to express
what you have to offer a prospective employer,

28
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,760
not to express aspirations.

29
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,944
For more junior profiles,

30
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,160
you can include information
on your educational background,

31
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,860
your main roles, functions
and areas of specialization,

32
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,080
the sectors in which you have developed
your professional experience,

33
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:00,862
your most relevant skills

34
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,260
and your sector and function of interest.

35
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,483
The second section, education,
is where you include

36
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,300
your academic accomplishments

37
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,160
starting with the most recent.

38
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,520
In no more than three bullet points,
you can list your most significant results,

39
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,160
such as a high GPA,
your most relevant courses

40
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,540
or any other relevant
extracurricular activities

41
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,740
that may increase the chances of getting a role.

42
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,990
Here is where understanding your industry
requirements plays an important role.

43
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,700
The professional experience section
should include any internships

44
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,970
and previous relevant work experience.

45
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,110
State your job title,
primary tasks and responsibilities

46
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,560
using the action verb + task + result format.

47
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,120
We will look further into how
to write winning bullet points in another video.

48
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,040
You can also include relevant information
about the company you worked for

49
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,785
such as the sector, their revenue,
the number of employees

50
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,120
or even their web page.

51
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,400
Languages, technical skills
and volunteering experiences are also key.

52
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,820
If these are very relevant
for the role that you're applying to

53
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,540
or something that you feel
will differentiate you from other candidates,

54
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,180
make sure you create a separate section for them.

55
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:19,200
Studies show that recruiters
spend less than 10 seconds deciding

56
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,830
if they want to continue reading your CV or not.

57
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,620
Make sure you make it easy to read,

58
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,386
keep a consistent format

59
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,360
and stand out the most important information.

60
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,930
Of course, no typos
or grammar mistakes are allowed.

61
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,140
So, are you ready to start writing your CV?
