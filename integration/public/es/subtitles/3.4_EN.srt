1
00:00:08,032 --> 00:00:09,894
The networking being done on LinkedIn,

2
00:00:10,058 --> 00:00:11,345
the one that really thrives,

3
00:00:11,505 --> 00:00:12,916
is informational networking.

4
00:00:13,229 --> 00:00:16,643
The kind that is driven by sharing
a professional content and opinion,

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,174
not so much the one that asked
for job referrals from the get go.

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,247
As I mentioned in the first section,
"Why using LinkedIn is a good idea?",

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,349
LinkedIn has over 500 million members,

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,500
it's one of the biggest databases
of people in the world.

9
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,520
The key is tapping into it

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,145
in a way that will help you achieve
your professional goals,

11
00:00:35,512 --> 00:00:37,538
both in the short and the long term.

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,218
I dare say most of you are looking to advance

13
00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:42,563
in your professional career after graduation,

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,480
yet others may be looking
to set up their own startup

15
00:00:45,574 --> 00:00:47,403
or expand their family companies.

16
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:49,225
Regardless of your objective,

17
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:51,690
we believe it's a good idea
to network on LinkedIn.

18
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,305
I want to share with you the best practices.

19
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,640
And with this thought
comes our number one advice,

20
00:00:58,123 --> 00:00:59,581
you are a valuable professional,

21
00:00:59,745 --> 00:01:02,330
and LinkedIn
is a professional networking platform.

22
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,138
Although it may seem daunting,
do not be shy about networking,

23
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:06,909
it's okay.

24
00:01:07,421 --> 00:01:09,356
To make it easier, here are some ideas

25
00:01:09,418 --> 00:01:12,196
on how you get started
with networking on LinkedIn.

26
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,749
Share and create relevant
and value added content.

27
00:01:16,098 --> 00:01:19,116
You may do this in the general board
and in groups.

28
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,501
This is a good opportunity
to position yourself as an expert

29
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:24,720
or a researcher of any given topic,

30
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,741
but it's an even better opportunity

31
00:01:28,018 --> 00:01:31,000
to share content
being posted by a prospective employer,

32
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:35,210
whether from the company page
or a personal profile in that company.

33
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:37,821
Say, for example, the Marketing Director

34
00:01:37,894 --> 00:01:40,774
if you're targeting a marketing function
in that company.

35
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,007
As in other social networks,

36
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,890
here, too, you can use hashtags
to promote your content,

37
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,643
and you can also tag people

38
00:01:47,872 --> 00:01:50,665
so that their network
will be able to see your posts.

39
00:01:51,192 --> 00:01:53,243
While sharing content,
comment on it,

40
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,000
share your input on why exactly
you find this content interesting.

41
00:01:57,738 --> 00:02:01,000
Plain sharing or just liking
are the easiest options,

42
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,625
but they're non-committal and other members
will miss out on your opinion.

43
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,654
Remember that while LinkedIn
is a social network,

44
00:02:07,858 --> 00:02:09,810
it is a professional social network.

45
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:14,265
What you post on Instagram or Facebook
may not travel well to LinkedIn.

46
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:16,538
So, think twice before posting something.

47
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,894
Keep it professional and share content

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,181
your professional audience will benefit from.

49
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,381
Join a group.

50
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,341
As populous
as the LinkedIn user community is,

51
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:28,352
you can still find smaller,
more targeted communities.

52
00:02:28,854 --> 00:02:31,003
There are over two million groups
on LinkedIn

53
00:02:31,127 --> 00:02:33,396
whose members rally around a specific sector,

54
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,323
function, geography, interest,
technical tool,

55
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:39,538
just about anything you can think of.

56
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:43,458
You would do well to join several
that have to do with your professional goals.

57
00:02:43,821 --> 00:02:47,178
They are the perfect place to share
questions, doubts or thoughts,

58
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,630
and you will find members to be
all the more engaged with each other,

59
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,803
as opposed, maybe, to the general feed.

60
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,814
Very often, you need to be granted permission
to be part of the group.

61
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,505
The process does not take long,

62
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:02,829
and you will be welcome personally
by the group administrator.

63
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,465
Right there, you will already have made
at least one meaningful connection.

64
00:03:07,763 --> 00:03:10,843
Follow company pages
to stay updated on their news,

65
00:03:10,956 --> 00:03:13,534
and demonstrate your interest
in working for them.

66
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,160
You can also comment articles they publish

67
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:18,890
and engage in the conversation
with your dream employer.

68
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,520
Overall, this is useful to understand
the challenges they're facing as a company,

69
00:03:23,872 --> 00:03:26,196
but also their achievements,
any team activities

70
00:03:26,287 --> 00:03:28,220
and award they have been awarded.

71
00:03:28,814 --> 00:03:31,520
Keeping up to date with their news
will give you insights

72
00:03:31,603 --> 00:03:32,716
on their company culture

73
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,334
and help you figure out
whether you're a good fit

74
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,436
and vice versa.

75
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,625
Following the company page
will also be useful

76
00:03:40,705 --> 00:03:42,952
to spot current and past employees,

77
00:03:43,065 --> 00:03:44,934
whether you're connected to them or not.

78
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,003
LinkedIn will generate
a specific set of search filters

79
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:49,000
that you can play with.

80
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,174
From these company-related profiles,

81
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,000
you will see what kind
of career development they have had,

82
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:56,418
or what background they typically come from,

83
00:03:56,734 --> 00:03:58,781
and when the interview
finally comes along,

84
00:03:59,178 --> 00:04:02,276
remember to look up the people
who will be interviewing you

85
00:04:02,418 --> 00:04:05,178
and the people in the team
you want to be a part of.

86
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,472
Where they studied, their experience,
their most recent posts on LinkedIn

87
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,970
will give you valuable insights
as to how to prepare for the meeting

88
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,916
and actually relate to them
during the interview.

89
00:04:16,294 --> 00:04:18,676
Follow your university and your school

90
00:04:18,952 --> 00:04:20,752
to be updated with the latest news,

91
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:24,614
both from what will be your Alma Mater
and from alumni,

92
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,600
as they will be one of the most valuable assets
of your education.

93
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:33,632
More than 70,000 alumni will be
the first people you get in touch with

94
00:04:33,734 --> 00:04:35,192
when you're building that network.

95
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,065
It is a great way to keep the connection alive

96
00:04:38,247 --> 00:04:39,887
well beyond your graduation date.

97
00:04:40,465 --> 00:04:42,487
Furthermore, you may be happily surprised

98
00:04:42,556 --> 00:04:45,200
with all the alumni initiatives
you can be a part of.

99
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,930
IE strives to support the community
for a lifelong experience.

100
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,396
Obtain informational interviews.

101
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:53,821
Like I mentioned earlier,

102
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,040
the kind of networking that really thrives
is informational.

103
00:04:57,501 --> 00:05:00,567
You may find people are very open
to sharing their advice

104
00:05:00,654 --> 00:05:04,923
and experience if they're asked in a way
that is respectful and constructive.

105
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,007
You may obtain informational interviews
from alumni

106
00:05:08,363 --> 00:05:09,989
and professionals in your network,

107
00:05:10,294 --> 00:05:14,301
such as co-workers, former co-workers,
someone in your LinkedIn group,

108
00:05:14,832 --> 00:05:16,163
and a long etc.

109
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,720
Your request can be preparing
for an upcoming interview,

110
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,003
getting insights on the sector,
comments on some article

111
00:05:23,265 --> 00:05:25,000
or advice on professional change.

112
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,610
You will find additional resources
and good conversation starters

113
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:29,898
with people in your network.

114
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,240
Finally, cultivate a network
you can tap into later for jobs.

115
00:05:34,745 --> 00:05:37,403
The LinkedIn network works with circles,

116
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,898
which means the more direct connections
you have,

117
00:05:40,247 --> 00:05:41,996
the wider your circle will be

118
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:44,440
in the second and third degree connections.

119
00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:47,909
But why do you need or even want this visibility?

120
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,000
Research shows that people
naturally tend to recall better

121
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,683
the people they have spoken to
in the previous weeks,

122
00:05:55,192 --> 00:05:58,283
rather than the people they have spoken to
in the previous year.

123
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,505
And this is regardless
of the strength of their connection.

124
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:05,181
You do not need to be
a prospective employer's best friend

125
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:06,363
for them to remember you,

126
00:06:06,774 --> 00:06:08,967
you just need to be in their top of mind.

127
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:11,701
If you are in touch with them recurrently,

128
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,589
chances are they will remember you

129
00:06:13,661 --> 00:06:16,698
and think of you as a possible candidate
when a job opens up.

130
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,872
You can stay in touch
through personal messages, of course,

131
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:21,545
but that is not the only way.

132
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,480
You will jog their memory if you post
relevant content and tag them.

133
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,101
Share an article they posted

134
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,240
or ask them their specific opinion
on a subject.

135
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,661
Set up a calendar to follow up
with key people in your network

136
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,105
to be sure to stay in employers' top of mind.

137
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,243
What matters is that you're present,

138
00:06:39,378 --> 00:06:41,800
interacting
in this unique professional forum,

139
00:06:42,156 --> 00:06:44,290
and you can make it extensive
to the real world.

140
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,298
Anyone you meet at an event or conference,

141
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,534
you can ask to be a connection
and keep in touch through LinkedIn.

142
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,429
This is common practice
and really helps to keep connections alive.

143
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,869
Just remember the golden rule:

144
00:06:57,221 --> 00:06:59,327
add a message to your connection request.

145
00:06:59,614 --> 00:07:03,523
It will help the person place you
and follow up with you in the future.
