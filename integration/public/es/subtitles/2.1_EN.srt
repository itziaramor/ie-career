00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,700
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:13,480
At IE Talent and Careers,
we understand the pain that you may feel

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,670
when applying to jobs.

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,880
That's why today we're going
to help you overcome some of this pain

5
00:00:18,984 --> 00:00:20,670
by focusing on cover letters.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,868
First of all, we recommend
you put as much focus and energy

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,390
into your cover letter as you do your CV.

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,200
A good cover letter
can make the biggest difference.

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,440
For example, if you're shortlisted for a position,

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,237
the hiring managers
will go through your cover letter

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,670
to make their final decision.

12
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,291
Before we begin, you need to have the following,

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,840
or else it's going to be
a dark and lonely place to get started.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,660
First things first:

15
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,600
time.

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,360
Cover letters take time to write.

17
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:56,370
So, we recommend you dedicate
at least 90 solid minutes to this task.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,880
Next, your CV should be ready and prepared

19
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,580
as if you were going to apply the same day.

20
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,940
Then, you need the job description
of the position you're applying to in front of you

21
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,930
and you need to know or have an idea
of what your competitive advantages are.

22
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,530
Now, what exactly is the cover letter?

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,960
A cover letter is a document
sent with your resume

24
00:01:20,225 --> 00:01:24,150
to provide additional information
on your skills and experience.

25
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,540
This letter provides detailed information

26
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,690
on why you are qualified
for the job you're applying for.

27
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,140
So, you shouldn't simply repeat
what's on your resume,

28
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,040
rather include specific information
on why you're a strong match

29
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,010
for the employer's requirements.

30
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,640
Think of your cover letter as a sales pitch
that will market your credentials

31
00:01:45,747 --> 00:01:47,430
and help you get that interview.

32
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,340
You want to make sure
your cover letter makes the best impression

33
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,960
on the person who's reviewing it.

34
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,088
Now you're thinking; "okay, great to know.
What do you include in a cover letter?"

35
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,740
Well, there are four sections in a cover letter,

36
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,000
which we will go through individually.

37
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,790
The first part is about you.

38
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,370
It's a self-introduction saying who you are
and the position you're applying to.

39
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,932
The second part is about them, the company,

40
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,410
explaining what you find appealing
about this particular company.

41
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,100
The third part is where you answer
the question "why me?"

42
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,270
What can you do for them that others can't?

43
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,540
Basically, what is your competitive advantage?

44
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,110
You can show this by giving examples
related to the job offer,

45
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,820
which you already have
in front of you as you write it.

46
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,960
And the fourth part is saying goodbye,

47
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,200
which is the closing
and how you would like to follow up.
