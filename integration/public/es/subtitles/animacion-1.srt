00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,740
The influence of IoT is everywhere
and it is influencing every part of our lives.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,839
It's an extensive network
of interconnected devices

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,280
which share data to make our daily lives
as convenient as possible.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,560
Let us take Maria as an example.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,520
She is a 32-year-old professional based in London

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,140
and living in an interactive building
on Liverpool Street.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,340
She works as the manager
of a large logistics company

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,040
in charge of transporting medical equipment
across the United Kingdom and Europe,

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,100
keeping the logistics process
at peak performance.

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,900
Maria's schedule is very hectic,
but thanks to IoT,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,580
she's able to make it to work on time every morning.

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,520
Let me tell you about Maria's daily routine.

13
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,420
Maria's alarm clock is set for 7 am every morning.

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,940
To help her get out of bed and start the day

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,860
the blinds on the windows
have automatically gone up

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,900
while the hot water is heating up her bath,

17
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,668
so she can have a nice warm bath,

18
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,080
thanks to the integration between
her smart watch and her smart house.

19
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,560
At 7:05 am she gets out of bed,
heads to the bathroom

20
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,910
and takes a quick bath to wake up
and start her day, full of energy.

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,263
While she's in the shower,
her Alexa gives her a full weather report,

22
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,320
a suggested route based
on the current traffic conditions

23
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,630
and a quick rundown of her day's schedule.

24
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,260
While she's still in her shower,

25
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,400
the connected devices in her kitchen
start setting everything up

26
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,700
for her breakfast routine.

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,880
At 7.07 her coffee machine
prepares her an espresso with warm milk.

28
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,060
Today she's feeling very tired,

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,520
so based on the sleep tracking app
on her smartphone,

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,970
she gets an extra shot of coffee.

31
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,590
At 7:15 am she gets out of the shower
and heads to her closet.

32
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,300
There, her smart mirror offers her
a combination of outfits

33
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,400
depending on the different activities of the day.

34
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,200
She gets dressed, and after breakfast,
she's ready to head out to work.

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,180
Oh!

36
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,310
She forgot to turn off the lights
in her apartment,

37
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,100
but thanks to the sensors,
they automatically turn off.

38
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,000
On her way to work, IoT is everywhere:

39
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,440
smart field irrigation systems,
smart factories, smart sports...

40
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,500
Everything based on data.

41
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,640
She gets to work at 8 am.

42
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,640
She gets out of her car and,
while approaching the building,

43
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,880
the office doors open automatically
with facial recognition.

44
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,620
Her first meeting starts at 8:10 am,
so while she's in the elevator,

45
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,160
she checks for room availability
in the corporate app,

46
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,490
based on real-time data.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,010
This room adjusts the lighting
and temperature based on body heat.

48
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,400
The Internet of things is also present
in Maria's personal life.

49
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,920
While she was at work,
her father unfortunately had a fall.

50
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,840
She immediately received
a notification on her smartphone,

51
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,804
which is connected to
his smart watch through an app

52
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,890
that notifies close family members
in case of accidents.

53
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,790
Maria called him an ambulance,
and when the paramedics arrived,

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,220
she was able to unlock her father's door remotely

55
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,620
for them to access the house.

56
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,040
Her father's all right now.

57
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,390
Maria's daily routine is from 8:00 to 5:00,

58
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,480
so by the time she gets back home from work,

59
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,520
IoT technologies have already put on
the air conditioning

60
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,810
and, based on her current location and time,

61
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,180
her smart TV is set to her favorite show.

62
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,640
Maria's life has been
significantly improved by IoT.

63
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,440
As you can see, IoT is everywhere!
