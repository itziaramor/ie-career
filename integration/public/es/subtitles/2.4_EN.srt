1
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,552
So, as you now know,

2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,360
a good cover letter will say a lot about you

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,120
regarding what you will be like as a person
if you were part of a team,

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,330
more so than your CV.

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,800
So, you want to guarantee
you promote yourself as best as you can.

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,150
Hence you should always double-check
your letter before submitting.

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,780
Here's a list of things
your cover letter must have.

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,760
Obviously, the heading should be at the top
with your personal contact information.

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,920
I want to highlight that you need to use
an email which you check frequently.

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,640
What you don't want to do is use
an email that you're not going to check

11
00:00:45,053 --> 00:00:49,380
because if an employer contacts you,
you're going to miss out on an opportunity.

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,110
The same goes for your mobile contact.

13
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,620
If you were to send out your application package

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,410
and the company wanted
to contact you that same day,

15
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,250
could they contact you at that number?

16
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,140
If so, then keep it.

17
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,480
So, always make sure that your heading
and personal contact info is always up to date.

18
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:07,960
Next,

19
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,320
you need to be sure that the body
of your cover letter has each section

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,580
and highlights what it should.

21
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,639
First part:

22
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:15,980
who are you,

23
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,246
what are you studying

24
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,770
and what are you applying for?

25
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,190
Second part: them, the company.

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,500
What is appealing about this company?

27
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,060
Why have you chosen them?

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,440
This is the part where you get to have fun

29
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,520
and highlight how they stand out to you.

30
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,130
Next, why you?

31
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,440
This is where you're going to connect the dots

32
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,310
between the company's job requirements
and your competitive advantage.

33
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,540
Then, the closing and follow-up.

34
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,310
Tell them that you're ready
for the next interview.

35
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:53,180
Another point we really want to highlight
is you must proofread, proofread, proofread.

36
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,450
You have to proofread
and double check your cover letter.

37
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,330
You need to confirm
there are no grammar mistakes.

38
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,600
Make sure that
your examples flow and are clear.

39
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,270
You don't want the company to assume anything.

40
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,440
One thing we highly recommend here
is to ask your peers

41
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,520
or those close to you,
preferably a fluent speaker,

42
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,820
to review your cover letter.

43
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,000
This will give you feedback
and positive criticism.

44
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,040
In addition, you can check

45
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,880
if your peer reviewers see the same message
you're trying to get across.

46
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,663
And last but not least,

47
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,810
try to keep your cover letter
between 300 and 350 words.

48
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,480
Why this word count, do you ask?

49
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,880
Keep in mind that hiring managers and recruiters
are reading many cover letters a day.

50
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,600
The last thing you want is a cover letter
that is two pages or 800 words long

51
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:47,240
and just a long run on sentence
or a never-ending story.

52
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,951
This is your chance
to show them that you're concise

53
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,620
and you can get to the point.

54
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,822
Remember,

55
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,160
you can always reach out
to your Talent and Careers career adviser.

56
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,890
Now, go write that cover letter.
