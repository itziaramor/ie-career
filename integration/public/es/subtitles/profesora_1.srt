00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,380
I am Konstantina Valogianni,
a professor at IE Business School,

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,230
and I'm going to introduce you
today to what machine learning is.

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,180
According to Tom Mitchell,

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,180
Professor of Machine Learning
at Carnegie Mellon University

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,080
and one of the firsts to create
a comprehensive definition of machine learning,

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,640
a computer program
is said to learn from experience,

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,760
with respect to some tasks
and a certain performance measure,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,140
if its performance of these tasks
improves with experience.

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,860
In other words, it is the science
of teaching a computer algorithm

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,950
to collect feedback
from previous performances

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,060
so that it improves its performance over time

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,400
with respect to a predefined objective.

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,040
For example,

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,000
a computer that learns to play checkers
might improve its performance

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,800
as measured by its ability to win
at playing checkers

16
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,310
by playing games against itself.

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,600
There are numerous examples
of using machine learning in business.

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,050
For example,
Amazon's recommendations are based

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,450
on learning from a user's previous preferences;

20
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,790
or Facebook is now able to use
face recognition to identify faces in pictures

21
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,810
using machine learning trained on past data.

22
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,520
And those are just a couple of them.
