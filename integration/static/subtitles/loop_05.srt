00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,430
What is IoT interoperability?

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,540
The ability of IoT devices, platforms
or protocols to communicate

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,250
and share services with each other.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,160
In IoT, the market is very fragmented.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,800
Because of this fragmentation,

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,920
as well as the availability and continued use
of legacy or old equipment,

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,560
it's common for IoT solutions
to not be able to talk to each other

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,720
or connect easily.
