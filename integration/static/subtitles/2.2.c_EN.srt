1
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,800
Now, in section three is when
you're going to talk about yourself

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,720
and explain why they should pick you.

3
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,460
This is where you match
your transferable skills

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,179
and your competitive advantage
with the job description,

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,150
which you have right next to you
as you write your cover letter.

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,120
Here we recommend using your personal brand.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,090
Think about how you want
the employer to perceive you.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,580
What do you want to promote about yourself?

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,570
We recommend you do this
while you're looking at the job description.

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,518
Pick the top key requirements
of that job description

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,510
and tell them how you can add a value
to their business and team.

12
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,600
Do not just tell them
you will add value to the business,

13
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,360
tell them how you will add value to the business.

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,740
Give them examples.

15
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,560
You do this by using your previous experience,

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,281
whether it be from team projects,
a higher-education program

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,190
or a previous job to highlight
your achievements.

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,970
These achievements should show
you have the skills and qualifications

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,830
required in the job description.

20
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,420
This is about what you can offer them,
not the other way around.

21
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,840
Something to keep in mind
regarding when to include soft skills.

22
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,800
They are very important to have,

23
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,180
but if you're applying for a technical role,

24
00:01:15,521 --> 00:01:19,000
they only want to hear
that you have great communication skills,

25
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,540
but more importantly they want to know
if you can do the specific details

26
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,240
and requirements the job tasks entail.

27
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,860
In these cases, you don't necessarily want
to focus on your soft skills.

28
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:30,840
Remember,

29
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,780
this is where you connect
the dots as much as you can

30
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,540
between what they're looking for

31
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,590
and the skills and competitive advantage
you bring to the table.
