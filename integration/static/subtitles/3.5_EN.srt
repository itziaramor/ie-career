1
00:00:09,323 --> 00:00:12,800
With 20 million plus open job listings
at any given time

2
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:14,661
and 30 million plus companies,

3
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:18,003
the abundance of information on LinkedIn
is incredible.

4
00:00:18,523 --> 00:00:21,000
It gives you the opportunity
to learn about your market.

5
00:00:21,163 --> 00:00:22,523
You can identify trends,

6
00:00:22,807 --> 00:00:25,003
like sought-after roles
and growing companies,

7
00:00:25,563 --> 00:00:29,003
or even see how one role varies
from one company to another.

8
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:31,250
Understanding what is needed out there

9
00:00:31,327 --> 00:00:34,210
will help you leverage your profile
and play on your strengths.

10
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,952
The numbers will definitely add up for you

11
00:00:37,207 --> 00:00:41,000
if you use the data in the framework
of a structured search strategy.

12
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,407
Let's see how you can use LinkedIn
as a tool in your search strategy.

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,687
You may define your target companies,
cultivate your network

14
00:00:50,014 --> 00:00:51,650
and find and apply for jobs.

15
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,225
Defining your target companies.

16
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,585
Find out which companies
are the best fit for you

17
00:00:57,701 --> 00:00:58,512
and list them.

18
00:00:58,872 --> 00:01:03,658
You can research by sector, by role
and even by alumni working there.

19
00:01:04,061 --> 00:01:07,309
This is actually a good indicator
that they value talent coming from IE.

20
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:10,541
You may be tempted
to let yourself get carried away

21
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:12,620
by the trends in your program.

22
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:14,941
But there are many great companies out there

23
00:01:15,003 --> 00:01:17,807
that can be a really good fit for you
and your future career.

24
00:01:18,316 --> 00:01:21,149
Find out more about them
by following them on LinkedIn

25
00:01:21,225 --> 00:01:23,432
and keeping up to date with their news.

26
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,356
Cultivate key contacts in each company.

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,996
If you network from the beginning of the program

28
00:01:29,054 --> 00:01:31,527
and follow relevant
sector-related professionals,

29
00:01:31,956 --> 00:01:36,309
chances are that you may get referred by them
for a job when it opens up.

30
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:38,610
The networking being done on LinkedIn,

31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,581
the one that really thrives
is informational networking,

32
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:45,312
the kind that is driven by sharing of content
and professional opinion,

33
00:01:45,836 --> 00:01:49,501
not so much the one that asks
for job referrals from the get go.

34
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:52,989
You can learn more about networking
with these prospective employers

35
00:01:53,076 --> 00:01:55,323
in the earlier section,
"Build your network".

36
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,469
So, form a well-established network
of professionals

37
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,829
that you can tap into later for jobs.

38
00:02:01,018 --> 00:02:02,720
Note the word, later on.

39
00:02:03,527 --> 00:02:04,861
Find jobs and apply.

40
00:02:05,447 --> 00:02:06,883
When you're ready to start applying,

41
00:02:06,938 --> 00:02:10,778
you will see an entire section
dedicated to this on the topmost menu.

42
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,781
Search for relevant jobs by title,
skill or company

43
00:02:16,156 --> 00:02:17,429
and then by location.

44
00:02:18,025 --> 00:02:20,054
Do remember to set up job alerts

45
00:02:20,112 --> 00:02:22,370
and manage them according to preferences.

46
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,454
If you are targeting jobs by company only,

47
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:28,520
you may also set up an alert
within the company page.

48
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,512
Once you enter your keywords for the search,

49
00:02:31,578 --> 00:02:36,698
you can browse for jobs using combinations
of all the filters at the top;

50
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:41,632
by sort, by company, by date,
by LinkedIn features

51
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,840
- more about this later -

52
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,887
and by experience required.

53
00:02:45,341 --> 00:02:47,800
When applying,
you will find two types of button,

54
00:02:48,029 --> 00:02:51,003
both blue
and fairly visible to the name of the job:

55
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:53,385
Apply and Easy Apply.

56
00:02:54,029 --> 00:02:55,552
What is the difference between the two?

57
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,250
The Apply button will automatically
redirect you to the company website.

58
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,145
Once there, you will go through
the company's own process of application

59
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:07,930
through their platform
or applicant tracking system, ATS.

60
00:03:08,698 --> 00:03:11,054
The Easy Apply button,
on the other hand,

61
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:14,792
will allow you to apply directly to the job
with your LinkedIn profile

62
00:03:15,032 --> 00:03:16,790
within LinkedIn as the platform.

63
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,549
My advice would be to try and avoid
the Easy Apply button

64
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:22,000
in favor of the Apply.

65
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,196
Easy Apply is indeed easy
and it takes little time, 

66
00:03:26,654 --> 00:03:29,727
but most companies manage candidates
from their own platform.

67
00:03:30,185 --> 00:03:34,116
It gives them much more traceability
and wealth of information on your profile.

68
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,301
Clicking the Apply button
and thus going through the company website

69
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,680
will bode well for you.

70
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,509
You will have the possibility to include
information tailored to the company

71
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:46,141
and additional documents,
such as a cover letter.

72
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,330
You will even be able to get
an official referral for your application

73
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,430
from someone from within the company.

74
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,840
If LinkedIn is the go-to source
for job listings globally,

75
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,260
it is very likely
competition will be quite intense.

76
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,803
So your edge,

77
00:04:01,978 --> 00:04:04,250
what will make you stand out
from the competition,

78
00:04:04,498 --> 00:04:07,454
will come from how effectively
you leverage your network.

79
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:09,487
The more time you invest

80
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:12,541
building your network
and your credibility on LinkedIn,

81
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,934
the more likely you are to have a unique insight
into the job of your dreams

82
00:04:17,185 --> 00:04:19,003
and possibly a referral for it.
