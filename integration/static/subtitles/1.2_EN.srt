00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:08,560
Hello.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,640
During this short video,
you will learn how to create bullet points

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,260
in order to show
your greatest accomplishments in your CV.

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,052
I will show you how to create your bullet points
focusing on your achievements

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,880
instead of the tasks you performed.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,853
To be able to do this,

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,980
we are always going to follow
the following structure:

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,930
action verb + task + result.

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,800
Let's take a look at
these two versions of one same CV.

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,120
This person is talking about
one same professional experience,

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,900
but the way that he focuses
on his achievements on the improved version

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,103
of his resume allows the recruiter
to really understand the impact

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,140
he had within his company and how much value
he really created for his customers.

14
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,540
You must always start your bullet points
with an action verb in the past.

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,490
Let's take a look at this example here.

16
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:06,220
We have "directed", "developed",
"empowered", "applied" and "recommended".

17
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,980
We can see that these action verbs

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,270
are already making your achievements
look a lot more powerful.

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,270
The next step would be your tasks.

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,460
In this case, it would be
"diverse teams of up to 18 people",

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,680
"re-branding strategy and comprehensive
integrated marketing communications plan",

22
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,980
"through training/education,
presentations and consultations

23
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,660
on due diligence and thorough risk assessment",

24
00:01:33,818 --> 00:01:36,987
"framework to several Southeast Asian markets

25
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,620
by conducting in-depth
primary and secondary research",

26
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,580
"manufacturer to move suppliers
from India to China".

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,423
The last step to have our bullet points
correctly formulated would be

28
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,000
to talk about the results.

29
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,880
Let's take a look again at the example.

30
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,503
The results shown
in these bullet points would be

31
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,800
"to successfully achieve annual objectives",

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,160
"to strengthen market position
and regional expansion

33
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,180
through value-add differentiation",

34
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,840
"to devise improved
business/marketing strategies",

35
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:17,350
"to make spot-on recommendations regarding
market potential, legalities and entry timelines"

36
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,900
and "lowering manufacturing cost by 20%".

37
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,400
Another important thing
that you should include

38
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,070
when drafting your bullet points
is quantitative information.

39
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,430
This helps the recruiters and hiring managers
really understand the impact of your actions.

40
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,980
"Teams of up to 18 people" or "reducing cost by 20%"
are two great examples

41
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,060
of quantitative information
you can include in your resumes.

42
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,860
As you can see, in all of our examples,
we have followed the same structure:

43
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,260
action verb + task + result,

44
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,700
adding quantitative information
whenever it's possible.

45
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,840
Please take a look at the CV writing guide
to see further examples

46
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,005
and to access a list of action verbs

47
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,130
that can get you started
writing amazing bullet points.
