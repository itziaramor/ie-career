00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,760
Why Now? We live in an era
of data abundance.

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,320
Thousands of sensors around us
are producing vast amounts of data,

3
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,610
which can serve as training sets
for machine learning algorithms

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,360
and make them improve their performance faster.

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,620
Furthermore, the infrastructure
required to program and run

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,920
the machine learning algorithms
is becoming cheaper and largely available.

7
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,220
For example, cloud services can help running

8
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,460
large scale machine learning algorithms,

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,580
reducing costs and
prohibiting resource requirements.

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,280
Finally, the processing capabilities
required to run

11
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,820
large-scale machine learning
are improving substantially.

12
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:51,780
Typical examples are graphic processing
units – or GPUs – that operate

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,910
much faster than our normal CPUs
in our computers,

14
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,090
speeding up the calculations required
by machine learning algorithms.

15
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,400
All this, namely
data storage and processing capabilities open

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,660
new (existing) paths for machine learning.
