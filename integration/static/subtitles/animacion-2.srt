00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,030
Hello again!

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,970
Let's find out more about Maria's life.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,072
As you recall,

4
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,600
Maria is an Operations and Logistics Manager
for a large producer of medical equipment

5
00:00:08,746 --> 00:00:11,980
with distribution centers
in the United Kingdom and Europe.

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,900
Every morning,
Maria has a walk around the factory,

7
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,680
which is full of IoT technologies

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,400
that enable the correct performance
and delivery of all processes.

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,540
The first thing that Maria does is log
into the control panel of the operation center

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,640
to make sure that all of the machinery
and processes are performing correctly.

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,660
This is done automatically through
sensors that enable face recognition.

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,620
When she's logged in,

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,180
she notices there's a warning alarm
on the main screen

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,640
indicating that machine number 3
needs to be restarted as soon as possible

15
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,200
due to a malfunction in its operating system.

16
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,200
The system suggests restarting
the machine after 9:00 pm,

17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,840
when production levels are low
and there's no interference with the workflow.

18
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,920
Using her corporate tablet,

19
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,540
Maria is able to decide whether to approve
the system's recommendation,

20
00:00:57,828 --> 00:00:59,980
set up a new time or ignore the warning.

21
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,620
The second activity Maria does
is walk around the factory

22
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,940
talking to the different engineers
that work there.

23
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,250
A new alarm pops up on her tablet.

24
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:09,720
It's a red alarm!

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,280
Peter, the engineer,
approaches Maria, grabs her tablet

26
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,560
and, using a code,
remotely enables a cool-down drill.

27
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,900
The cooling system around machine number 2
starts to bring down

28
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,690
the engine's temperature automatically.

29
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,040
The factory is safe!

30
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:24,820
After this event,

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,270
Maria is able to keep walking around the factory.

32
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,790
Do you remember Maria's security helmet?

33
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,160
This helmet is also connected
to the factory system via IoT.

34
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,191
This type of equipment allows organizations
to provide safety measures

35
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,620
for all employees working
in risky environments.

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,139
Nevertheless, this is not magic,

37
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,290
as some accidents cannot be predicted

38
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,340
and as the common saying goes:
"accidents do happen!"

39
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,090
A new notification pops up in her tablet.

40
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,820
It says: "Use caution in aisle 4!"

41
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,680
Given this information,
Maria decides to avoid aisle 4,

42
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,640
and sends a report to the security department.

43
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,920
This is a normal day in Maria's daily routine

44
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,090
with IoT solutions
in the operations and logistics field.

45
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,060
How do you think IoT can affect other areas?
